# homebrew-angora
homebrew installer for http://www.angorafdtd.org

This is a port of [Angora: A free finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetic 
simulation package](http://www.angorafdtd.org/) for the macOS operating system. See my updated
forked source on [github](https://github.com/drjrkuhn/angora).

Make sure [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/index.html) is already installed. Then run

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew tap drjrkuhn/homebrew-angora
$ brew install angora
```

Angora should be installed to `/usr/local/bin/angora`
